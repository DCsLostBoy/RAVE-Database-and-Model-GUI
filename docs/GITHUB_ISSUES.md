- Add overhead estimates for PyTorch Lightning
- Display warnings if requirements exceed available VRAM

**Formula Components**:

    model_parameters * 4 +  # FP32 weights
    model_parameters * 4 * 2 +  # Optimizer states (Adam)
    batch_size * signal_length * channels * 4 +  # Batch data
    activations_estimate +  # Intermediate activations
    overhead  # Framework overhead
) / (1024 ** 3)  # Convert to GB
