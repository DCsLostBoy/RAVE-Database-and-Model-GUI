## Conclusion

This backlog provides a clear roadmap from initial setup through v1.0 release and beyond. The critical path focuses on core functionality while allowing flexibility for nice-to-have features.

**Key Principles**:

1. **Start simple**: MVP first, features later
2. **Iterate fast**: Short sprints with demos
3. **User feedback**: Test with real users early
4. **Quality over quantity**: Better to have fewer features that work perfectly
5. **Flexibility**: Adjust priorities based on learnings

**Next Steps**:

1. Set up development environment
2. Start Sprint 1
3. Demo after each sprint
4. Adjust backlog based on feedback
