## üéØ Key Decisions Already Made

### Technology Stack

- **Framework**: PyQt6 (native Python, cross-platform, rich features)
- **Database**: SQLite (embedded, portable, sufficient)
- **Audio**: sounddevice + librosa
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib (embedded in Qt)
- **Architecture**: MVC-inspired with Qt signals/slots

### Architecture Patterns

- **CLI Wrapper**: Use subprocess to wrap existing RAVE CLI
- **Threading**: QThread for all long operations
- **Database**: SQLite for metadata, filesystem for actual data
- **Signals**: Qt signals/slots for cross-component communication

### Implementation Approach

- **Start Simple**: MVP first, features later
- **Iterate Fast**: Weekly demos, continuous feedback
- **Test Early**: Unit tests from the beginning
- **Document Continuously**: Docs alongside code
